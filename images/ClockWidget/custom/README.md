# ClockWidget

To use the custom clock face, replace the JPGs in this folder with your own creations.
Make sure to save them as 240px * 240px and DO NOT enable progressive encoding.

Then add
`#define USE_CLOCK_CUSTOM true`
to your config.h

If you want to disable the nixie clock, set
`#define USE_CLOCK_NIXIE false`
